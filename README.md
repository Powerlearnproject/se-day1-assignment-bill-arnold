#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the process of applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop high-quality software systems and it is important in creating high-quality and easy-to-use software systems for various industries example communication, healthcare, education and also other aspects of modern life


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ne milestone is the development of programming languages, the second milestone is the development of the agile methodology in the 2000s and the third is the development of software engineering as a discipline in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements- checking and compiling what is needed for the development of the software eg. the minimal viable products 
designing - this entails designing the infrastructure, architecture and the user interface of the software 
implementing - coding and development of the software 
testing - making sure that the software meets the MVP and the user requirements
deployment making the software available for the user and this can be done using deployment technologies eg. varcel and render
maintaining - continuous support and updating the software for continuity and smooth running while users are interacting with the software 





Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is sequential and rigid and thus follows a specific predetermined path during development while the agile methodology  is iterative and flexible thus during development it is easy to adapt in case of changes in the development cycle. Waterfall is best used when the project is being performed under a strict budget and timeline while agile is best used when the project is evolving 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- the responsibility of the software developer is to write codes and develop the software 
quality assurance Engineer- the role of the quality assurance is to ensure that the software that is developed meets the set quality standards 
project manager - the responsibilities of the project manager include helping the team to design, execute, and monitor the project 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software that gives you an environment to write your codes, debug and also run the codes for development an example is Visual Studio code, while VCS is software that helps in tracking your development work during development eg. Git 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
some of the challenges faced by software engineers are changes in the project requirement, tight deadlines for delivering the project and technical debts , some of the Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing involves verifying individual components or units of the code, such as functions or methods, in isolation. Developers typically perform this testing to ensure each unit works as intended. Its importance lies in catching issues early in the development process, helping maintain code quality, and preventing future bugs during code changes.
Integration Testing

Integration testing focuses on how different modules or components interact with each other. Even if individual units pass unit tests, integration tests ensure that their interactions function correctly. This testing is vital for identifying issues related to data flow, communication, and system dependencies, ensuring that combined components work smoothly together.
System Testing

System testing evaluates the entire software system as a whole. Conducted in an environment that simulates production,it verifies that the integrated system meets the specified requirements. This testing is crucial for assessing the system's overall functionality, performance, security, and usability, ensuring it works as expected from a userâ€™s perspective.
Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing is the final phase, where the software is evaluated against the business requirements. Often performed by end-users or clients, it focuses on determining if the system meets the agreed-upon criteria. This testing is essential for gaining stakeholder approval and ensuring the product is ready for release.





#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering




Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise inputs to guide AI models and optimizing their responses. By providing clear and specific prompts, users can improve the relevance and quality of AI-generated outputs. The importance of prompt engineering is vital for extracting accurate and useful information from AI. Well-designed prompts reduce ambiguity, making AI interactions more efficient and reliable across various applications.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague Prompt: "Tell me about the weather."
    Improved Prompt: "What is the current weather in New York City, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation?"

The improved prompt is more specific, reducing ambiguity. It gives the AI clear instructions, leading to a more accurate and relevant response.
